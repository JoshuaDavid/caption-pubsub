        <h1>Pub / Sub Captions</h1>
        <p>
        This is a very basic system for allowing one person to write captions
        and many other people to read them. To get started, head over to the
        <a href="./pub.html">Publish Stream</a> page. On that page, you will
        find a link titled <b>View Stream</b>, which you can distribute to all
        of the people who want to view that stream, and a textarea in which
        you can enter text. Enter text in that box, and everyone who is
        viewing the stream will see what you've entered.

        <p>Have fun!</p>
